"""The draft's starting state: draft.json as a Board, or a fresh one.

By default the draft does not start empty: `draft.json` (written by
`draft_pipeline/fetch_draft.py`) is the live board, and it is the simulation's initial
state. Made picks are already on their teams' rosters and off the pool; the simulated
draft plays out only the picks that are still pending, in the order that file says they
will happen — which is where traded picks enter, since a pick's owner there is the roster
that will actually use it, not the slot that originally held it. `rankings.json` then
covers the undrafted players only, because a drafted player is not a decision any more.

Nothing about the method changes on a live board. The fixed point still measures the
wire over whole final rosters — made picks plus simulated ones — so wire levels are
levels for this league, not for the remainder of it. With no picks made the board is
the static snake and the output is identical to `--no-draft`; `--selftest` checks
exactly that.

Two facts about a live board this cannot value:

  * A pick can land on a player the pool does not carry — a kicker, an IDP, anyone past
    the pool's 350-player cut. There is no projection to price him with, so he is held
    as an `off_pool` roster entry: he fills a spot (so the team owes one fewer pick) and
    satisfies a mandatory position (a rostered QB means the team no longer needs one),
    but he never starts and is never worth anything. That is the right treatment for a
    kicker and a slight understatement for a real player just past the cut.
  * Made picks are facts, not decisions, so they are never re-valued. If a team reached,
    the board takes that as given and prices what is left.

    One type covers both cases so there is a single simulation path. `fresh_board()` is a

    `draft.json`. The simulation only ever plays `order`, so an untouched board plays all
    290 picks and a live one plays the pending tail.

    Teams are indexed by draft slot (1..10, minus one), because that is what `MY_SLOT` and
    the reversal rule are expressed in. `order` holds the slot of the team that *receives*
    each remaining pick, which is the acquirer for a traded pick, so a trade shows up as a
    slot appearing at a board position that is not its own column.
