        With per-horizon pricing there is no single within-position ordering: the best
        year-1 body (a flat veteran) and the best years-2-3 body (a backloaded rookie, an
        injury-recovery veteran) can be different players, and either can be the right
        pick depending on what the roster is missing. So each position offers the head of
        both horizon lists, deduplicated — without this, a startable veteran sitting below
        a backloaded player on one list could never be drafted while that player remained.

        A lineup needs 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR and 1 TE from positions that nothing else can
        cover, so a manager cannot spend every pick on the best name available and end up
        without a quarterback. Once the picks remaining are exactly the unfilled mandatory
        spots, candidates narrow to the positions still owed. This is the honest way to stop
        a team punting a position — the earlier attempt distorted the value of an empty slot
        instead, which broke the board.

        The 4 taxi spots are rookie-only, so at most 25 of a team's 29 players can be
        veterans: once a team holds 25 non-rookies, only rookies are eligible. The cap is
        on veterans, not on total bodies — a team that took its rookies early is free to
        spend its last picks on veterans.

        `off` is the team's already-drafted players the pool cannot value. They count here
        and only here: they occupy a roster spot and they answer a mandatory position, so a
        team that spent a live pick on an unranked quarterback is not made to draft another.
        draft.json does not say whether such a player is a rookie, so they count as
        veterans — conservative, it can only force a rookie one pick early.
